# Password Strength Checker

This project is a **Password Strength Checker** built in Python. It evaluates the strength of a given password based on predefined security criteria and provides actionable feedback to improve weak or moderate passwords.

---

## Features

- **Password Strength Evaluation**
  - Checks against five criteria:
    - Minimum length (default: 8 characters)
    - At least one uppercase letter
    - At least one lowercase letter
    - At least one digit
    - At least one special character
  
- **Actionable Feedback**
  - Identifies and suggests improvements for missing criteria.

- **Customizable Criteria**
  - Easily adjust the minimum password length or special character set.

- **Simple CLI Interface**
  - User-friendly interaction through the terminal.

---

## How It Works

1. **Input Password**: Users enter a password through the CLI.
2. **Check Criteria**: The program evaluates the password based on the following:
   - Length
   - Uppercase and lowercase letters
   - Digits
   - Special characters
3. **Strength Rating**: Passwords are rated as:
   - **Weak**: Meets 2 or fewer criteria.
   - **Moderate**: Meets 3 or 4 criteria.
   - **Strong**: Meets all 5 criteria.
4. **Feedback**: Missing criteria are displayed for improvement suggestions.

## Example Output

```plaintext
Welcome to my  Password Strength Checker!
To create a strong password,your password must include the following::
  - At least 8 characters
  - A mix of  Uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Numbers and special characters

Enter a potential password: MyPassword123

Your password is rated as: Moderate
Suggestions to improve your password:
  - Add a special character (!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~)
```

---

## Potential Improvements

- Add a dictionary-based check to warn users against common or compromised passwords.
- Implement a real-time strength checker in a GUI using frameworks like **Tkinter** or **PyQt**.
- Extend to a web-based tool using **Flask** or **Django**.
- Add localization support for non-English-speaking users.
